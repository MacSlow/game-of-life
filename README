This is a SDL2-based implementation the famous "Game Of Life"-automaton by John
Conway. Some background theory can be found here:

 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life

A brief screencast of the code in action can be seen here:

Available interaction control-keys:

 * <ESC> - quits program
 * <RETURN> - resets simulation

The dependencies are modest:

 * cmake 2.8.12
 * C++-14 compiler (e.g. g++, clang++)
 * SDL 2.0.5

It compiles and runs under recent Linux-distributions (e.g. Ubuntu 16.04). It
should run with little or no changes under MacOS X and Windows 7 (or more 
recent) too. But that has not yet been tested. Feedback and patches are
welcome.
